# Student-Final-Grade
# This project calculates a student's potential final exam grade and final grade in the class. 
# It makes the assumption that the class grade is point based out of 1000, and that the student only has the final exam left.
# The final exam is worth 200 points, so 800 points of the class have been calculated into the student's grade already.
# It will ask about the student's current grade before the final exam and whether or not they will study. 
# This project will loop until the user does not want to calcualte another grade.
